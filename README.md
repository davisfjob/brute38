BIP38 brute force password cracker, written in Go

Based on Charlie Hothersall-Thomas' implementation, but added features, bugs fixed, and expanded with more command-line options and better support for variable-length passwords.

See Charlie Hothersall-Thomas' original implementation at: https://github.com/chigley/bip38

Requires:

Go Language
Installation/Compilation:

go get
go build
Running:

./brute38
The above assumes you have Go set up properly and you copied the code into your GOPATH/src somewhere.
